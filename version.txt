2.25-2.26
Internal releases

2.22
- fixed reading of barcodes with <CR> inside
- changed barcode initialization to enable composite barcodes reading and improve reading quality

2.21
- barcode initialization changes, resulting in better recognition on shiny surfaces
- changed authentication sequence, so it complies with the ATS 2.0 software

2.20
- fixed Linea may sometimes send magnetic card data with wrong session id, resulting in data loss

2.19
- added hardware support for Linea 4

2.18
- fixed issue where the reader may fail to go to sleep after reading magnetic card, while in a sleep state, resulting in constant battery drain until iOS requests connection again

2.17
- added support for different flash memory chip
- fixed some settings are being destroyed when firmware update is done from the iOS device

2.16
- added GS1 Databar barcode series support

2.15
- changed algorithm for calculating remaining battery, should be more stable now and not jump around

2.14
- increased communication buffer size, that was preventing the firmware update from functioning properly

2.13
- changed the get charging command to return separate values when charge is from the own battery or external power
- removed previous attempt to provide authentication with AES128 key
- added AES256 encryption of the card data upon request, support for multiple encryption keys, ability to load keys OTA (using encryption with previous key)
- reintroduced device authentication using separate AES256 key
- ability to detect and enable synchronization when usb cable is connected (works only on latest batch of Linea 1.0 boards and on all official Linea 1.5 and 2.0 releases)

2.09-2.12
Internal releases

2.08
- fixed Linea sometimes stalls for 1.8 seconds if magnetic cards are scanned extremely fast

2.07
- minor fix in authentication part to comply wit ATS 1.5

2.06
- minor fix to not send DevACK after AckDevAuthenticationInfo

2.05
- merged Linea 1.0 and 1.5 source code base
- added commands to set AES128 key and then encrypt a single block of data and return it, useful for distinguishing specific device
- added command to disable automatic turning off the barcode engine, and instead of that keeping it in low power mode (useful to keep the 2D barcode engine powered, so next scan is instant)

2.02
- Linea will electrically disconnect and reconnect upon entering/leaving sync mode
- Linea will stay connected in sync mode, allowing to operate with both the iPod and the Linea while they are connected to each other (loading software, on device debug)

2.01 
- speeded up barcode scanning, generally the barcode scanning will be more responsive 
- added functions to control barcode engine directly 

2.00 (this version is based on 1.08 so it contains charging. Additional commands will be added to control the barcode engine directly) 
- fixed track 2 data being returned with track 1 markers if the card is missing track 1 
- added new command to switch to extended barcode types mode. In this mode, following barcode types are supported:

1.10 (based on 1.07 code) 
- fixed track 2 data being returned with track 1 markers if the card is missing track 1 

1.08 (internal) 
- upon starting charge, Linea will electrically disconnect, then reconnect again, allowing to communicate while charging 

1.07 
- added validation to every command parameters and ST1 is used to notify about the result of the operation 
- fixed command for setting beep sound was returning 1 byte less 
- fixed command for playing sound was returning random byte at the end 
- enable charging command modified - instead of being a single command to start the charge, it was modified into SET/GET command and accepting ENABLE/DISABLE charging to be ready for the future, when Linea will be able to charge and communicate at the same time 
- fixed charging command repeats the answer if the Linea's voltage is too low to start the charge 
- fixed Linea goes to IdentifyDeviceLingoes only when receiving Bad parameter to StartIDPS, it was going there on invalid packets too 
- added a check for battery level right after reset that was missing, Linea will no longer try to authenticate and turn off when battery is extremely low 

1.06 
- fixed command to get the current status of sync mode (was returning 0 every time) 
- fixed loading of serial number was not always successful and had to be repeated 

1.05 
- first officially released
